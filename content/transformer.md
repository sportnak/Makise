### Building a Cross Relational Transformer
Transformers are a relatively recent addition (introduced in 2017) to the machine learning and AI developer's toolkit. They leverage the principles of Recurrent Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks to effectively model complex relationships, not only across iterations of data but also within the data itself. In this article, we will explore the mechanics of transformers and discuss this custom transformer I am currently working on and contributing to (built initially by my brother).
