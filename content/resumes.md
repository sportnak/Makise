## Resumes

I recently resumed the job search after stepping out of a role at a startup where I was working 60-80 hours a week (talk about exhausting). As a result, I needed to update my resume. I went ahead and added my experience and sent it out without changing the formatting much. I got a few people to review it, added some tweaks, but overall left it as is.

Sorry if you have to zoom, but lots of text, single column, 3 pages. A lot of content. Hard to read. Kind of boring and based off my college experience (9 years ago) telling me to look professional.

Here's the new version

Looks a lot more refreshing right? Modern, sleek, brief. I removed a lot of experience that just didn't seem relevant anymore. Cut everything to one page. And I'll customize it to each opportunity I apply to, keeping this one as a base. Two columns allows me to put the stuff everyone needs to see on there, but still keep my experience as the first thing that people see. Clean and fresh.

I've just started sending it out, so I'll post again in a few weeks about this to see if we've gained any traction with this new format. This should be a fun opportunity to do some A/B testing on resume formats.

Cheers!
