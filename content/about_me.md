Hi, I'm Michael. I'm a full stack software developer with a focus on
React/Typescript. I enjoy learning new things and working on awesome
projects.

A few of the things I'm learning and writing about on this blog are
Tech, Books, Management, Personal Development, and literally
anything else that comes into my head. As you may learn, I've got a
lot of opinions on a lot of different things (not always accurate,
but I try).
