It's been a while since I've posted anything here. I've always kind of thought the pressure to post regularly on any sort of outlet was a bit much. Especially for someone like me who struggles with the blank page syndrome (not knowing what to do with an empty page) but also has 30 things floating through my head at any given point in time.

I'm sitting here with my son who is almost 4 weeks old is in my arms and I'm typing over him. It's 6am and I'm watching One Piece. I got my laptop out and was just staring at it trying to figure out what I _should_ be doing. I poked around a few different things and then received a notification from Heroku that my apps were going to be spun down. That's where I had initially hosted this page before moving it over to Netlify for ease of maintenance.

I do want to post here more often, but I don't plan to set requirements of myself just yet. It's still a fun thing to do and as I remember I'll add notes about the projects I've worked on. But for me - it's about the joy in sharing what I've learned. Don't let the content other people push out make you feel guilty about taking your time or keeping your hobbies to yourself. It's ok to do nothing extra for a while. Sometimes even just getting by is hard enough.

I will encourage others to write when you can. Sharing your thoughts and progress with others is a great way to share joy and build connections. It's helpful in building up your communication skills. In short - do what you can because you want to, not because you think you have to be productive all the time.
