Well, well, well. So you've found me out. Congratulations are in order. Why? Not really sure.

If that whole introduction there threw you off guard I'm sorry, but that's how I write. I'll probably use irregardlessly more than once and I won't have anyone edit the copy on my page. At least, not until I have more than 10 people looking at this page.

Either way, I'm glad you're hear and you've decided to check out my personal webpage. I had a webpage that looked cooler a while ago, but I didn't really have time to manage it. Besides, I <b>know</b> how to do web programming. So I'll add some flair to this site where I can figure it out. But in the meantime, I'm just going to use this to put down my thoughts on things that I find interesting.
