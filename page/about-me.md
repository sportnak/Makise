Hi, I'm Michael. I'm a full stack software developer with a focus on React/Typescript. I enjoy learning new things and working on awesome projects.

A few of the things I'm learning and writing about on this blog are Tech, Books, Management, Personal Development, and literally anything else that comes into my head. As you may learn, I've got a lot of opinions on a lot of different things (not always accurate, but I try).
